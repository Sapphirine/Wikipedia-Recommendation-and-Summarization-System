# Wikipedia-Recommendation-and-Summarization-System

The world is overloaded with information. There are so many different resources
online and things we could learn to expand our horizon. For this project, we put together a tool
that allows people to learn things quickly and continue to explore topics that they are interested
in. Thus, we developed an Wikipedia Article Summarization and Recommendation systems, that
allows user to preview their articles, and also continue to explore articles of similar topics. We
use over 500,000 English Wikipedia articles (total data size: 5GB) for our algorithms. The
project required us to work extensively with Natural Language Processing techniques, ranging
from data processing to algorithm implementation.
